  ‚úîÔ∏è API
     <br >
     An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It‚Äôs sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an   
     information user‚Äîestablishing the content required from the consumer (the call) and the content required by the producer (the response). For example, the API design for a weather 
     service could specify that the user supply a zip code and that the producer reply with a 2-part answer, the first being the high temperature, and the second being the low.  

     In other words, if you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform a function, an API helps you communicate what you want to that system so it can 
     understand and fulfill the request. 
 ‚úîÔ∏è REST
     <br>
     REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.
     When a client request is made via a RESTful API, it transfers a representation of the state of the resource to the requester or endpoint. This information, or representation, is   
    delivered in one of several formats via HTTP: JSON (Javascript Object Notation), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is the most generally popular file format to use because, 
    despite its name, it‚Äôs language-agnostic, as well as readable by both humans and machines. 

    REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer and an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. Roy Fielding first presented it in 2000 in his famous     
    dissertation. Since then it has become one of the most widely used approaches for building web-based APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
    Like the other architectural styles, REST also has its guiding principles and constraints. These principles must be satisfied if a service interface has to be referred to as RESTful.
    
    üëâ A Web API (or Web Service) conforming to the REST architectural style is called a REST API (or RESTful API).
