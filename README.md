  ✔️ API
     An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It’s sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an   
     information user—establishing the content required from the consumer (the call) and the content required by the producer (the response). For example, the API design for a weather 
     service could specify that the user supply a zip code and that the producer reply with a 2-part answer, the first being the high temperature, and the second being the low.  

     In other words, if you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform a function, an API helps you communicate what you want to that system so it can 
     understand and fulfill the request. 
 ✔️ REST
     REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.
     When a client request is made via a RESTful API, it transfers a representation of the state of the resource to the requester or endpoint. This information, or representation, is   
    delivered in one of several formats via HTTP: JSON (Javascript Object Notation), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is the most generally popular file format to use because, 
    despite its name, it’s language-agnostic, as well as readable by both humans and machines.
